                <h1>Plot</h1>
                <p>Devil May Crie is a massive game that throws players into a world where archons rule over the land, and elemental
                visions are granted to worthy mortals. The game follows the dense main character called Traveler as they go on a quest to find their missing step-sibling
                and build their own harem with the strange Paimon. Armed with the power to tap into the elements without a vision, the Traveler breaks all the
                laws within Teyvat and performs near-impossible feats. To find their sibling, they must venture to all seven regions and learn the hidden truth surrounding the world.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                <p> Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable
                characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use
                several different combinations of skills and attacks. Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways,
                such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips.[6] In addition
                to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges
                that reward highly valuable resources, such as Stormterror and the Electro Hypostasis, but claiming them uses up a
                currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time.Completing these challenges grants the player progress
                towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level.
                The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating
                them gives.
